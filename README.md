## Running the project

### Prerequisites

First, a machine running [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and the option to clone the repository. The rest of the setup is explained in [Part 1](https://getstream.io/blog/discord-clone-project-setup/).

Second, an account with Stream. We have a [free tier](https://getstream.io/pricing/#chat), and we can create an account for free using [this link](https://http://getstream.io/try-for-free/).

### Running locally

The first thing to do is install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then we can run the project on our machine in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
